Still unable to compile in windows using minGW, waiting on nxlog guys to lend a hand.

In any case,

Install MinGW
Download apr, pcre, openssl, zlib
Install (configure + make + make install)

Download nxlog-ce
./configure works but make fails (see https://meocloud.pt/link/a36b6b4e-5949-4d58-841b-c73032ca7b04/nxlogmakeerrors.txt/)

Will try to get back to this as soon as possible but it might be a few weeks...

Drop me a message on freenode, user "nowan" if you want to tackle this
